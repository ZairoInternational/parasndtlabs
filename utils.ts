    description: `The ID oxide scale is produced by oxidation in the Boiler Tubes.
        The scale build up occurs when the tubes have experienced high
        temperatures for extended periods of time. The formation of ID
        scale reduces heat transfer and results in a further increase of
        tube metal temperature. The increase in ID scale and the
        associated tube metal temperature promotes creep in the tube
        metal. Formation of creep results in a loss of strength at high
        temperature and therefore a loss in remaining life. The final
        outcome of excessive scale is a long term overheats failure. Our
        advance Ultrasonic Testing equipment and highly experienced

        utilizing multi-element probes, which are individually excited under computer control.
        Both PAUT (Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing) and TOFD (Time of Flight
        Diffraction) are forms of ultrasonic testing (UT) that are used by NDT
        inspection services to evaluate assets for flaws and defects. Like PAUT,
        TOFD uses sound waves to detect flaws by measuring the time that it takes
        for the sound wave to be emitted and returned. However, the difference
        between PAUT and TOFD is that TOFD measures both high and low
        amplitude waves. That is, PAUT records only high amplitude waves that are
        retuming from the back of the asset, while TOFD records both high amplitude
        waves and low amplitude waves that deflect off of the tips of flaws and
        defects.
        Now, Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing is widely used in steel fabrication industries as an alternative method of testing in lieu of radiography testing for thick wall materials.
